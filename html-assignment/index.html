            </header>
            <p>
                I am an 18 year old boy who recently joined Algonquin college on may 8<sup>th</sup> 2023 for studing
                <abbr title="Intractive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.
                I completed my high school before taking this course. My dream is to become a game designer and in the
                future i might create a gaming company.
                Also i love editing my gaming videos so whenever i get free time i utilize that time by editing videos.
            </p>
            <p>My inspiration is my father his name is Tom he is a businessman he is also my superhero because even
                during bad times he have supported me and still supports me.
                whenever i do wrong things he rectifies me and leads me in the right path.Even when he is sad he does
                not show that instead he shares his happiness with the family because he wants our family to be
                happy.
                He always says</p>
