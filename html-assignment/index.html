                <h2>About me</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                I am an 18 year old boy who recently joined Algonquin college on may 8<sup>th</sup> 2023 for studing
                <abbr title="Intractive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.<br>
                I completed my high school before taking this course. My dream is to become a game designer and in the
                future i might create a gaming company.<br>
                Also i love editing my gaming videos so whenever i get free time i utilize that time by editing videos.
            </p>
            <p>My inspiration is my father his name is Tom he is a businessman he is also my superhero because even
                during bad times he have supported me and still supports me.<br>
                whenever i do wrong things he rectifies me and leads me in the right path.Even when he is sad he does
                not show that instead he shares his happiness<br> with the family because he wants our family to be
                happy.
                He always says
            <blockquote>
                <p>"eventhough you know that you won't stand a chance just give your best"</p>
